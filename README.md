  <h1>Brevity of Gravity</h1>

  <p>
    This game was developed as a student project in 10 weeks at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    For some of us, this was our first non-theory encounter with object orientated programming, Blender, 3D modeling, Game Design and so on. <br /> <br />
