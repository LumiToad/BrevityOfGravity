  <h1>Brevity of Gravity</h1>

  <p>
    This game was developed as a student project in 10 weeks at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    This was my first non-theory encounter with object oriented programming, Game Design, Blender, 3D modeling and so on. <br /> <br />

  <h2>Engines / Languages</h2>
  Godot, GDScript, a tiny amount of GLSL

  <hr />
  <h2>Roles</h2>
  - Gameplay programming -<br />
  - Tool programming -<br />
  - Game Design -<br />
  - Technical Lead -
  
  <hr />
  <h2>Responsiblities</h2>
  - The entire gameplay programming -<br /><br />
  Including UI, Features, everything.<br />
  Since I started learning programming only a few month prior, I had some help from teachers, implementation was still my responsibility.<br />
  <br />
  - Create tools, using Godot features -<br /><br />
  Created tools for level / game design, such as:<br />
    <li>Camera Control Zones</li>
    <li>Audio Control Zones</li>
    <li>Tutorial Control Zones</li>
    <li>Dialog Boxes</li>
    <li>Player Movement</li>
    <li>Level exit / Checkpoint control</li>
    <li>Enemy hp, speed, range, etc.</li>
    <br />
  - Communication with artists and game designers -<br /><br />
  As a small Team of seven people, everyone was involved with Game design.<br />
  Some initial ideas, the chains and some level design guidelines and the documentation of these concepts were part of my work.<br />
  Game design however was not my main responsibility.<br /><br />
  Explaining tools, communicate about file formats, implementation of assets and solving other problems was daily business.<br /><br />
  - Administrative work -<br /><br />
  Managing version control (back then - Mercurial using TortoiseHG), maintaining website and itch,<br />
  Google Drive and other software related things, prepared the build for presentations.<br />
  Besides managing (and learning) version control, this wasn't much workload though, as my team did a good job.
